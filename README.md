# Historical Image Pre-Processing
Library to pre-process scanned historical images for Structure from Motion (SfM) surface reconstruction and photogrammetric analysis.

### Features

#### Data Query and Download
- Download imagery from historical image archives 
- Supported archives:
  - North American Glacier Photography (NAGAP)
  - USGS Earth Explorer

#### Fiducial Marker Detection 
- Built-in application to create fiducial marker templates
- OpenCV template matching to detect fiducial marker coordinates
- Fiducial markers are detected at sub-pixel precision
- Can detect 4 midside and/or 4 corner fiducials
- Replaces poor matches with np.nan based on threshold
- Computes estimated principal point
- Quality Control
  - Outputs window image around detected fiducial marker for visual verification
  - Creates qc plots for fiducial coordinates and intersection angles before and after affine transformation
  
#### Fiducial Marker Proxy Detection 
- Routines to detect proxy for midside fiducial markers, when actual fiducial markers are cropped out of image frame

#### Image Restitution 
- Computes affine transform between calibrated (true) fiducial marker coordinates and detected coordinates
- Affine transforms images
  - Requires minimum of 3 successfully detected fiducial markers to perform restitution
- Crops images about principal point to standard size
- Contrast Limited Adaptive Historgram Equalization (CLAHE) to improve match point detection during SfM processing

### Examples
